    "\n",
    "**Command mode** is indicated by a grey cell border. When in command mode, the structure of the notebook can be modified as a whole, but the text in individual cells cannot be changed. Most importantly, the keyboard is mapped to a set of shortcuts for efficiently performing notebook and cell actions. For example, pressing **`c`** when in command mode, will copy the current cell; no modifier is needed.\n",

    "#### Mouse navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "The first concept to understand in mouse-based navigation is that **cells can be selected by clicking on them.** The currently selected cell is indicated with a grey or green border depending on whether the notebook is in edit or command mode. Clicking inside a cell's editor area will enter edit mode. Clicking on the prompt or the output area of a cell will enter command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second concept to understand in mouse-based navigation is that **cell actions usually apply to the currently selected cell**. For example, to run the code in a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item. Similarly, to copy a cell, select it and then click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-copy icon-copy\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Edit -> Copy`** menu item. With this simple pattern, it should be possible to perform nearly every action with the mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells have one other state which can be modified with the mouse. These cells can either be rendered or unrendered. When they are rendered, a nice formatted representation of the cell's contents will be presented. When they are unrendered, the raw text source of the cell will be presented. To render the selected cell with the mouse, click the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class=\"fa fa-play icon-play\"></i></button> button in the toolbar or the **`Cell -> Run`** menu item. To unrender the selected cell, double click on the cell."

    "#### Keyboard Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "The modal user interface of the IPython Notebook has been optimized for efficient keyboard usage. This is made possible by having two different sets of keyboard shortcuts: one set that is active in edit mode and another in command mode.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following shortcuts have been found to be the most useful in day-to-day tasks:\n",

    "- Basic navigation: **`enter`**, **`shift-enter`**, **`up/k`**, **`down/j`**\n",
    "- Saving the notebook: **`s`**\n",
